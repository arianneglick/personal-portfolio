    <p>My name is Arianne Glick. Iâ€™m a technical writer and editor currently based in Salt Lake City, UT.</p>
    <p>I got my BA from Brigham Young University, where I studied English and Editing. I also studied Web Programming and Development at the Mountainland Applied
        Technology College in Lehi, Utah. My studies in both of these fields have allowed me to both effectively work with developers and to employ new technology to
        improve my documentation.</p>
    <p>My career includes full-time and contact positions, as well as freelance work. I have technical writing experience in the construction and maintenance of user
        guides, online help, operations manuals, and release documentation. I also have experience in editing academic journals, term papers, and manuscripts. I have
        worked both as the sole provider of technical documentation and in a documentation group.</p>
    <p>For more information on my professional background, see my resume and LinkedIn profile, or contact me.</p>
